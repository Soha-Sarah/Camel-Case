# Camel-Case  
A simple Python program for camel case  

# How To Use This Code:  
You need to paste the code in an IDE that supports Python  
Let's say you want to output "Hello World"  
You need to write the code:  
```python
print(split_camel_case("HelloWorld"))
```

Problem About This Code:  
You need to use capital letter after each word for the code to understand that it is a new word  
if you write:  
```python
print(split_camel_case("Helloworld"))
```
The output will be "Helloworld"
